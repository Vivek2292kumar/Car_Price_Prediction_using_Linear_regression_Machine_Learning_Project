🚗 Car Price Prediction Project
This project presents a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars based on various features. The model is trained using a dataset containing vehicle specifications and is visualized with insights to aid in understanding the factors that influence car prices.

📌 Objective
To develop a predictive model that can estimate the selling price of a car based on key features like brand, manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, and mileage. This helps car dealers and individuals assess vehicle value more accurately.

📂 Project Structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered insights about car prices and their relation to other features.

Model Building: Trained multiple regression models and selected the best-performing one.

Evaluation: Compared models using metrics like R² Score and RMSE.

Visualization: Used Power BI (or can be integrated with Tableau) to visualize key insights like brand-wise price comparison, fuel type distribution, and mileage vs. price trend.
